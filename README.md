# CODSOFT 
Welcome to my Python Internship Project Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have developed during my internship, showcasing my skills and proficiency in Python programming. Each project serves as a demonstration of various concepts, techniques, and problem-solving abilities I have acquired through this internship.

# Projects
1. Calculator
The Calculator project is a command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using Python's fundamental concepts and demonstrates my understanding of user input handling, conditional statements, and modular programming.

2. Todo-list
The Todo-list project is a console-based application that helps users manage their tasks and to-do items. It utilizes concepts of lists, loops, and file handling in Python. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, remove tasks, and view the list of tasks. This project underscores my proficiency in data structures and file I/O operations.

3. Quiz-Game
The Quiz-Game project is an interactive quiz application that presents users with a series of questions on various topics. Users can choose answers, receive instant feedback, and get their final score upon completing the quiz. This project highlights my ability to design interactive applications using functions, loops, and conditional statements.

4. Rock Paper Scissor
The Rock Paper Scissor game is a classic hand game implemented in Python. It allows users to play against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer responds with its choice. The winner is determined based on the game's rules. This project showcases my grasp of random number generation, user input validation, and game logic implementation.

5. Password Generator
The Password Generator project is a utility for generating strong and secure passwords. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, and the application creates a random password meeting the specified criteria. This project emphasizes my knowledge of string manipulation, random module usage, and creating user-customizable tools.
